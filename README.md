# Python Overlays
Transparent, topmost, borderless, relatively high-performance windows

This repository is mostly provided as a learning resource. While the 
overlays are used in a piece of production software, I do not guarantee
that they work on all systems. There may be serious bugs and if you 
want to use any `Overlay` implementation in your program consider
using it as a `b√®ta`-status option. 

The `TkinterOverlay` has been properly tested and can be combined with 
other GUI frameworks if necessary. It is neither high-performance nor
transparent on Linux-systems, but it does offer an alternative that 
should always work.
